By default, this boilerplate is configured to support the latest two versions of the most popular desktop and mobile browsers.

You can find a list of what browsers this boilerplate supports [here](https://github.com/awkaiser/browserslist-config-google/blob/master/index.js).

We're configuring our list of supported browsers in the `browserlist` propertry of our `package.json` file. Feel free to change it in case your default browser support doesn't suit your project.
